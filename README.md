# My Config

Just my linux configuration Files and stuff.

Most people won't find it useful, but it's an easy way to backup it.


## ZSH + Powerline

1. Need to install [powerline](https://powerline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and zsh
2. `/usr/share/zsh/site-contrib/site-contrib/powerline.zsh` file is taken from Arch Linux config
